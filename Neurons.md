Basic class of cell found in the central nervous system (CNS)
Primary processor of neural signals

Transmitting electrical signals to target cells is primarily the function of neurons, not [[Neuroglia]] cells.

Formation of [[Neurons]]

Posses all the metabolic machinery common to other somatic cells
![[Pasted image 20230430195654.png]]
They are distinct to other somatic cells by
- Neurons come in a rich diversity in morphology 
- Bioelectrical propeties - secretion of special chemicals called neural transmitters
- specializations for intercellular communicatio

## Funtional micronanatomy of Neurons
![[Pasted image 20230430200255.png]]
An abundance of mitochondria to keep up with the inmense amount of energy. The cell body is very important and many protoplastic (1.  of or relating toÂ [protoplast](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protoplast "protoplast"))extensions grow out.


There are different mophologies of neurons with different shapes and distribution of [[Dendrites]] is a way that  used to classify this type of neurons.

Some neurons are multipolar.  

When you have hundreds of thousands of neurons running in parrallel that is called [[Gray matter]]


## Pyramidal neurons 
excitatory neuron which are [[Pyramidal cell]]

We can see the [[apical dendrite]]  and the [[basel dendrites]]

Here We can see in blue an [[axon]] propagating the signals

Another example
![[Pasted image 20230501192703.png]]

Their are  [[Interneuron]], because it doesn't project very far at all. So within the same bit of gray matter we can have projection neuron.


### How does information typically flow through a neuron?

synapse -> dendrite -> cell body -> axon -> synapse

### Which set of microanatomical structures are typically found in [[white matter]]?

vascular endothelium, axons

There are essentiall three types of neurons:
![[Pasted image 20230523105745.png]]
[[Sensory Neuron]]- conver external stimuli into electrical signals

[[Interneuron]] - process and realy information 

[[Motor Neuron]] - convert electrical signals into muscle or giand movement


On the membrane of each neuron are ion channels and ion pumps and establish a difference of Na, k, Cl , Ca within the cell.

[[Axon]] nerve ending form synapses with [[Dendrites]] of adjoining neurons

## So how does information flow
A brief overview would be that:
	The is a change in balance of pre and post synaptic ions generating a action potential that generate a synaptic release.

	![[Pasted image 20230523111459.png]]
	The ESPS  can by recorded by placement of electrode inside neuron where influx of ions causes increase in voltage.
	
Here [[Neurotransmitters]] take place. There are over 50 [[Neurotransmitters]] identified.
