The development of the [[Brain]]

### How the brain develops throughout time:
The human brain essentially develops from the bottom up with cortical development completing last.

1.  Prosencephalon (Forebrain): The forebrain develops into two major components:
    
    -   Telencephalon: This gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres, including the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and lateral ventricles.
    -   Diencephalon: This forms structures such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and third ventricle.
2.  Mesencephalon (Midbrain): The midbrain develops into structures that include the tectum (superior and inferior colliculi) and cerebral aqueduct.
    
3.  Rhombencephalon (Hindbrain): The hindbrain further divides into two parts:
    
    -   Metencephalon: This gives rise to the pons, cerebellum, and upper part of the fourth ventricle.
    -   Myelencephalon: This forms the medulla oblongata and lower part of the fourth ventricle.

These primary divisions of the embryonic neural tube give rise to the major regions and structures of the brain during development.
