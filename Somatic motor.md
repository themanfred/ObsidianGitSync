Two somatic motor nuclei in the [[Midbrain]]
- Oculomotor superior and trochlear just inferior.

The next Somatic motor nucleus we have in the caudal [[pons]] and it's associated with the 6th nerve [[Abducens Nerve]]. It's the abducens nucleus.

And then, the final Somatic motor nucleus, the 4th of that first group is down in the [[Medulla oblongata]]. The upper part of the medulla associated with the roots of the 12th nerve and it is called the Hypoglossal nucleus [[Hypoglossal Nerve]]
