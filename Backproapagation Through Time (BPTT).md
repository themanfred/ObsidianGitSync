1. Start with input
2. The idea of backpropagating gradients back through the network.
	1. Take the derivative (gradient) of the losss with respect to each parameter
	2. Shift parameters in order to minimize loss
3. We have this temporal unrolling.
	1. Whe we do backpropagatio, we go from every step from where we are now to the very beginning
