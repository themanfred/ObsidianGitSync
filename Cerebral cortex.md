This would be above the diencephalon 

One of the most significant steps in the evolution of the human cerebral cortex is the enlargement of the cerebral cortex, which occurs mainly by areal expansion and folding of [[cortical surface ]]without a comparable increase in [[cortical thickness]]

The cerebral cortex is a thin layer of gray matter that covers the entire surface of the hemispheres. Most of the cortex that is visible from the surface in humans is known as [[neocortex]], cortex which is made up of six layers of [[neurons]]. Phylogenetically older cortex, which has fewer cell layers, is found on the inferior surface of the temporal lobe, separated from neocortex by the rhinal fissure (Figure 3). The cortex with the fewest layers (three) is known as the hippocampus(paleocortex of the parahippocampal gyrus).
