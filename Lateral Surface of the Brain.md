Near the dorsal midline is the superior frontal gyrus.

Also the middle
We can also find the Inferior fronatl gyrus

superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, that are separated by two meandering sulci, an inferior frontal sulcus, and a superior frontal sulcus.
posterior boundary 

Behind  the central sulcus is the long, mostly straight [[Postcentral gyrus]]

 two structures as an [[Inferior parietal lobule]],

[[Interparietal Sulcus]] This  sulcus runs in the long axis of the hemisphere, 

approaching the central sulcus at nearly a right angle.

[[Parieto- occipital Sulcus]] In the  back of the occipital lobe

So if we can draw an imaginary line from that parieto-occipital sulcus, down to a notch formed by the way the dura tends to restrict the development of the inferior surface of the occipital lobe, we have a boundary that roughly divides the occipital lobe from the parietal lobe.

This notch that we can see right about in this region,  that's called the pre-occipital notch because it helps to define the interior boundary of the occipital lobe.


And now let's go inferior to the lateral fissure, which is located right here, and explore the features of the temporal lobe. From the lateral surface of the hemisphere, we see three long, straight, parallel gyri, known as the superior,  the middle, and the inferior [[temporal gyri]].
