Machine learning is insde AI.

AI was a set of predefined set of rules and then it would spit out an output.

Machine learning figures out the rules for us.
Take the data and the output of what it should be and then it generates the rules.
This is why it needs so much data.

**Goal for ML models:** Highest accuaracy posssibe.
Rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us.


THe big hype is NN or deep learning

Neural NetworkL A form of ML that uses a layered representation of data. 
![[Pasted image 20230404094652.png]]

Our data is transformed through different layers to get an ouput.
A multi stage extraction process.

They are not modeled after the brain. We do not know how the brain works so we are still not able know enough.


**Vector Features :** Any information that we habe that we can give the model.
Feature is the equivalent of an attribute of a method in cs

**Lable:** Ouput information that we are trying to find.

**Sample:** They are the items to process.
**Feature space** It refers to the collection features that are used to characterize your data.

Here using this features we want to predict the label. In this case the midterm2

When we are training data, we have all the features and all the labels. Then when we want to test the model we would not have the label and pass the features to see how it predicts the label.

Types of learning
- [ ] Supervised learning

- [ ] Unsupervised learning
- [ ] Hybrid models


A Nural Net

A ML of how a neureons work in the human brain, where given the number of inputs the nural will propagate a signal depending on how it interprets the neurals


### Amount of data vs. performance  

![[Pasted image 20230406113204.png]]

Better models have larger neural nets and bigger data sets

Data science and ML have fussy boundaries.


### Strenght and weaknesses of machine learning

ML tends to work well when:
1. Learning a simple concept
2. 2. There are lots of data available

ML tends to work poorly when:

1. Learning complex conecepts from small amounts of data
2. It is asked to perform on new types of data

What can ML do and cannot do

So what it can and cannot do 
![[Pasted image 20230406125436.png]]
It can determine the distance of a car

But it cannot tell human intention, all of them are rasing their left arm for different reasons.  It will be extemely difficult in this situation.
