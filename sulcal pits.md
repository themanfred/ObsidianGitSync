sulcal pits have been identified from [[MRI]] to reflect [[putative]] [[first cortical folds]] in mature brains. 

A sulcal pit can be identified in a[[ sulcal catchment basin]] by using the structural information of small gyri buried in depths of sulci called [[Plis de passage]] (the focal elevation of the sulcal bottom)

The first surface-based sulcal pit study identified 48 and 47 sulcal pit clusters in the whole left and right hemispheres respectively with most major sulci containing 2 or more clusters.

The frequency and spatial density of the sulcal pits were high in the clusters in the central, postcentral, intraparietal, subparietal, middle frontal, and collateral sulci, the junction between superior frontal and precentral sulci, and the junction between inferior frontal and precentral sulci. The first major folds in those areas might develop and deepen at similar positions between individuals.
