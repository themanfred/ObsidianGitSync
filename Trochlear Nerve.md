One is that it's the only motor nerve that exits on the posterior or the dorsal side of the central nervous system. So, to see the trochlear nerve, we have to gently reflect away the [[cerebellum]] from the inferior surface of the temporal lobe.

This fine little thread structure right here at the tip of my pointer, this is the trochlear nerve. 

The trochlear nerve exits on the dorsal aspect of the caudal midbrain, wraps its way around the brainstem and works its way towards the orbit, where this nerve is involved in controlling one particular muscle that moves the eye downward and inward.

It's unusual because it emerges from the dorsal aspect of the brain stem. 

It's the only motor ax, It is the only motor nerve to do so. All the other motor nerves exit the ventral. And lateral regions of the central nervous system
