Sulcal roots was introduced to represent the first cortical folding locations by Regis et al. (2005). 

They suggested that the shape and location of sulcal roots may be stable across individual at the fetal stage and sulcal variability at the adult stage may result from the chaotic behavior of the folding process (Regis et al., 2005)

It has been hypothesized that the first cortical folds develop into the deepest local regions of sulci with spatial invariance during development, which are termed [[sulcal pits ]](Im et al., 2010; Lohmann et al., 2008).
