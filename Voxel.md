In [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics "3D computer graphics"), a **voxel** represents a value on a [regular grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grid "Regular grid") in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). As with [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel") in a 2D [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap "Bitmap"), voxels themselves do not typically have their position (i.e. [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate")) explicitly encoded with their values. Instead, [rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics) "Rendering (computer graphics)") systems infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels (i.e., its position in the [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") that makes up a single [volumetric image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display "Volumetric display")).

In contrast to pixels and voxels, [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(computer_graphics) "Polygon (computer graphics)") are often explicitly represented by the coordinates of their [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") (as [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)")). A direct consequence of this difference is that polygons can efficiently represent simple 3D structures with much empty or homogeneously filled space, while voxels excel at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non-homogeneously filled.
