Just inferior to the [[pons]] there is the [[Medulla oblongata]]

In the medulla there are two stuctures called the [[Medulla Pyramids]]


![[Pasted image 20230508202059.png]]
This is a very important fiber pathway that runs through the brain stem. 

It's called the [[corticospinal tract]], and there's one on each side of the midline. These tracts contain the fibers of the motor cortex that are sending their [[axons]] down into the [[spinal cord]] to govern voluntary movement.

Next to the [[Medulla Pyramids]] there is lateral to the medulla the [[Olive]]

What we se looking at the [[Telencephalon]] in the anterior which is the inferior surface of the [[frontal lobe]]

Sits about the oribits in the skull so we call it the [[Orbital cortex]]

This would be a view of the brain with the [[cerebellum]] removed:

From the lateral [[temporal lobe]] to the [[Occipital lobe]] we can find the 
[[Occiitotemporal Gyrus]]

And then along the medial edge of the temporal lobe, there's a structure that we call the [[Parahippocampal Gyrus]].

And deep in the anterior part of the temporal lobe, in this position, this 
[[parahippocampal gyrus ]]folds in upon itself into a structure that we call the [[hippocampus]].

At some point of the [[Occipital lobe]] we can find the boundary of the [[Lingual Gyrus]]  near the midline, and what remains here of the [[Occiitotemporal Gyrus]] o
