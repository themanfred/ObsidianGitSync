[[Neurons]] has <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">axons</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">soma</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dendrites</mark>.

The more [[dendrite]] activity there is the more connections the [[axon]] will have

### Synapse 

Connection between [[Axon]] of one neuron and dendrites of another.

We can put a number of the strenght of that connection 
Stong connection 1
no connection is 0

Where this [[synergies]] can be represented tike this

In this case the size of the soma would be represented by the 
weight and/or the thickness of the line

The first time this values are assigned they are done completely at random

In this case the following is ACE, becasue those are the strongest connections

Same thing would happen here!

### Gradient descent 
The error can shift a little

Each node represents a pattern, a combination of the [[neurons]] on the previous layer

IF a network has more than three layers it's deep!
![[Pasted image 20230408160344.png]]

The more layers the more complex the anser is and so do the patterns and calculations needed.
