That comes from a nucleus called the Edinger Westphal which sits just superior and a little bit lateral to the ocular. 

The motor nuclei up in the mid-brain at the level of the 3rd cranial nerve. 
The next place where we have parasympathetic outflow is associated with nerves 7 and 9. And that outflow comes from a set of nuclei that we call the salivatory nuclei. Now we could subdivide them into a superior excuse me a superior and an inferior group. 

But to keep this 4x4 scheme going, we'll just collectively consider them the cell of a toy nuclei. Okay, well, the next major parasympathetic outflow to consider comes from 2 nuclei. A division of the nucleus ambiguous, which is separate from the one that provides Branchial motor outflow. 

This division is responsible for the cardio inhibitory output that goes to the heart from the vagus nerve. 

Well, the other major parasympathetic outflow to consider in the vagus nerve comes from a nucleus called the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Alright, well that accounts for our, three groups of motor nuclei.
