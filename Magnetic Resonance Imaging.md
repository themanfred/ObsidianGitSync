Turning to Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which is also a nuclear-imaging technique, it uses both static and variable magnetic fields to perturb hydrogen atoms.

The perturbation of these hydrogen atoms causes a [[Magnetic resonance]], that is then measured by radio-frequency coils. 

These radio-frequency receivers will convert this information into a three-dimensional image, and different pulse-sequences can be used to generate different contrasts,  depending on the tissue type. 


(In other words H atoms  are used to generate macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined.[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging]]

The Magnet is always on. The magnetic fieldis generated by up to 20km of copper coils which  cool down the metal and this makes the coils super-magnetic.
