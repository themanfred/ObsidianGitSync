**Micro**: Small lithography based, self-assembled or 3d printed
**Electro**: Electrical engineering; integrated cicits, devices
**Mechanical** : Mechanical and fluidics a=of IC-fabricated structures; integration of mechanical with electrical; electromachanicsl transducers (sensors & actuators): diferent types of energy
**Systems**: The least well addressed vision of MEMS; packaging and partition are big issues

## So where does it begin? 

- 1961 - first silcon pressure sensor (Kulite)
	- Diffused Si piezoresistors mounted onto package to form diaphragm
- Mid 60s resonate gate transistor
	- Nathanson et al. 
	- Dialectric capacitor
	- ![[Pasted image 20230516161608.png]]
	- Stanfor's Gas Chromatograph (1975) (Mixture separation)
		- SC Terry 
	- 70s Ke Wise neural probes
	- 70's Start of TI DMD project
- 1982 Kurt Peterson's *Silcon as a mechanical material*
-  1983 BSAC (Howe, Muller) Polycrstalline silicon micromechanical beams
- 1987 Bill Tang, Roger Howe USB Comb-drive resonator
	- move laterally to surface

## Where is the current research - BioMEMS
- BioMEMS
	- Shows promise for diagnostics
	- Next era of quanititave biology
	- No commercial winners yet

## MEMS are not academic curiosities

We are at the beginning of an era of deep penetration of MEMS products into eveyday life
**There are MEMS products eveywhere**

## MEMS Flexible beam  - lab process

- We will be making cantilevers and bridges - fundamental transducers used in many applications:
	- Sensing
	- Actuating, enrgy harvesting
- RCA clean

Depending on the amount of Si, the refraction  increases based on the amount if SiH2cl2 vs NH3 ration and the s higher the refractive index the lower the residual stress of the material..

SiX- I add a mask or something to cover it. I can get to thingd depending on what I use.
THe blue is where they added the match, the purple is the protected structure whenit is exposed to light

The materials depend more on their cristaline structures

BEam bending - Anticlastic Curvature
Ina beam, the poisson ration cause opposite bending in the transverse directions with no stresses

The Posson ratio: que tanto se vurva dependiendo de que tanto estres lo ponen.

A plate is a beam tha
