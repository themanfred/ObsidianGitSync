What we can see from the cut brain is the [[Prosencephalon]]

![[Pasted image 20230504123542.png]]

The [[Cerebral cortex]] is [[Telencephalon]] 
![[Pasted image 20230504123724.png]]

We will also find the [[Diencephalon]] 


Just on top of the diencephalon we can find the [[Corpus Callosum]] 

![[Pasted image 20230504124458.png]]

Above the corpus callosum we find the [[Cingulate Gyrus]]

Above this [[Cingulate Gyrus]] we can find the [[Cingulate Sulcus]]

Superior to the cingulate sulcus is the [[Superior Frontal Gyrus]]

Where we will find the [[Paracentral Lobule]] above


Then posterior to that [[Central Sulcus]] and just behind the [[Cingulate Sulcus]] we find the [[Precuneus gyrus]]


There we will [[Parieto-occipital sulcus]] and the [[Precuneus gyrus]]. Almost orthagonal to the [[Parieto-occipital sulcus]] we find the [[Calcarine Sulcus]]

Below the [[Calcarine Sulcus]] we find the [[Lingual Gyrus]] that forms something of a tongue.

Above the [[Calcarine Sulcus]] we find the [[Cuneus Gyrus]] that forms something of a wedge.
