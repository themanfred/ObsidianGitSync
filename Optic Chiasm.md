Chiasm means x or a cross, so it's a crossing of the nerve fibers that form these two optic nerves.

Just behind the optic nerves is the floor of the [[diencephalon]] or the ventral surface of the [[Hypothalamus]].

Here it is prone to grow tumors and because of the structure they tend to grow towards the [[Optic Chiasm]] .

So visual field deficits are the first and earliest  sign of a problem in the [[pituitary region]].
