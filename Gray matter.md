Gray matter are the [[cell bodies,]] [[dendrites]] and the synaptic connections of [[neurons]]

Then we will also find [[White matter]] which is the conductiong zone.

One is a group of complex nuclei, known as the basal forebrain nuclei, which have become associated with the signs and symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease (see Figure 8). Like the [[Basal Ganglia]], the basal forebrain nuclei are made up of clusters of cells (rather than layers); but unlike the basal ganglia, these clusters are much smaller and typically much less compact. They are located ventral to the anterior commissure and below the basal ganglia, between the [[ventral striatum]] and the [[hypothalamus]].

The [[amygdala]], which is a large mass of gray matter buried in the anterior-medial part of the temporal lobe, anterior to the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus (see Figure 9). The amygdala is an important component of ventral-medial forebrain circuitry and it is involved in the experience and expression of emotion. It was once classified as part of the basal ganglia; however, it is structurally and functionally heterogeneous, with systems of neurons and intrinsic connections that are comparable to those in striatum and the cerebral cortex.
