A very optimized verision of arrays that allow us to do a lot of calculations and very quickly manipulate operations on it.

NumPy is the main package for scientific computing in [[Python]]. It performs a wide variety of advanced mathematical operations with high efficiency. In this practice lab you will learn several key NumPy functions that will help you in future assignments, such as creating arrays, slicing, indexing, reshaping and stacking.


We use the in our [[Jupyter Notebooks]]


[[Numpy arrays]] are a part of the reason people use this lib

With these arrays we can do [[array math operations]]
