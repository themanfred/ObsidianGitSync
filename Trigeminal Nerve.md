A large nerve that penetrates right through the lateral aspect of the [[pons]] and this nerve has been cut fairly close to the pons so we don't have a long length to show you.This tuft of [[nerve fibers]] that's right at the end of the pointer here that's penetrating down through the [[axons]] that connect the pons to the [[cerebellum]].

Rostral to these nerves is cranial nerve V, the **trigeminal nerve**, which appears to plunge right into the fibers traversing the basal surface of the pons.
