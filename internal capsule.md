 The internal capsule lies just lateral to the [[diencephalon]], a portion of it separates the caudate from the [[putamen]]. Many of the [[axon]]s in the internal capsule terminate or arise in the [[thalamus]].

**[[white matter]]**  that separates the thalamus from the putamen (and globus pallidus)

- the caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens become continuous around the rostral margin of the internal capsule;
- (2) the globus pallidus is a relatively small structure located near the middle of the basal ganglia; 
- (3) the globus pallidus is located between the internal capsule and the putamen; 
- (4) the thalamus occupies a more posterior volume of brain-space than the bulk of the basal ganglia;
- (5) the caudate nucleus has a long “tail” that follows the course of the lateral ventricle into the temporal lobe (see again Figures 4 & 5). 
- (6) the anterior limb of internal capsule separates the head of the caudate from putamen and globus pallidus, and the posterior limb of internal capsule mainly separates thalamus from globus pallidus
