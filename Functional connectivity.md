Functional connectivity is the degree to which the activity of two brain regions is correlated.

By measuring functional connectivity, [[fMRI]] can be used to identify the different functional networks in the brain. These functional networks are involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as attention, memory, and language.

The [[Default mode network]](DMN) is a large-scale functional network that is active when the brain is at rest. The DMN is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as self-reflection, autobiographical memory, and planning.

Another important functional network is the [[Salience network]] (SN). The SN is involved in detecting and responding to salient stimuli in the environment. The SN is also involved in switching between different cognitive tasks.

By measuring functional connectivity, fMRI can be used to study how these different functional networks interact with each other. This can help us to understand how the brain works and how it is affected by different diseases.![[Functional_Connectivity_MRI_Studies.pdf]]

Hebbian principle: Cells that fire together, wire together.

look at the [[Voxel]]

Look for correlation both spatially and temporally.

#### What information can be obtained from functional connectivity MRI studies that cannot obtained from structural imaging or task based fMRI studies?

In the Functional Connectivity MRI, brain activity is able to be observed in the absence of external tasks, demands, or stimuli. 
The brain activity is able to be measured at rest, which is not possible through the use of structural imaging of task based fFMI. 

Structural MRI's are primarily used to analyze pathology in different areas. fMRI's analyze a brain based upon a patient performing an instructed task.

How it relates to [[Diffusion Tensor Imaging]]

Overall, rs-fcMRI and DTI complement each other by capturing different aspects of brain connectivity and providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between structure and function. Integrating the findings from these techniques enhances our knowledge of brain organization, connectivity, and neurological disorders.
