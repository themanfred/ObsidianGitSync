Functional connectivity is the degree to which the activity of two brain regions is correlated.

By measuring functional connectivity, [[fMRI]] can be used to identify the different functional networks in the brain. These functional networks are involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as attention, memory, and language.

The [[Default mode network]](DMN) is a large-scale functional network that is active when the brain is at rest. The DMN is involved in a variety of cognitive functions, such as self-reflection, autobiographical memory, and planning.

Another important functional network is the [[Salience network]] (SN). The SN is involved in detecting and responding to salient stimuli in the environment. The SN is also involved in switching between different cognitive tasks.

By measuring functional connectivity, fMRI can be used to study how these different functional networks interact with each other. This can help us to understand how the brain works and how it is affected by different diseases.
