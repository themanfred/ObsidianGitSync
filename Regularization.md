A technique that contains our optimization problem to dicourage complex models which result in [[Overfitting]].


For #Example using this model  there is the dripout model

### Dropout

Randomly select a subset of this neurons and with that probability turn them on or off. This way it is solving to differenand build internal pathways.

So it is internally creating new internal models and trying to figure out new path ways and capture some deeper meaning within the neural network.

Makes it easier to train because there is a lower amount of pathways.


### Early Stopping

- Stop training before we have a chance to overfit.
