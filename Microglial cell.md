- Type of [[Neuroglia]]
- Special type of[[ mononunclear phagocyte]] that resides in the CNS
- Derived from hematopoietic precursor cells that migrate into the brain during development
- Exists in one of two forms: amoeboid and ramified
	- The [[ramified form]] is the dormant state
		-  lying in wait
	- The [[amoeboid form]] is the activated, mobile state when microglia cells are engaged

- Secrete signaling molecules that modulate local inflammatory resposnses
**Glial cells**Â are thought to derive embryologically from either myeloid cells of the hematopoietic system (microglia) or neuroepithelial progenitor cells (astroglia and oligodendrocytes).
