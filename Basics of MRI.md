Proton spin anti || or || to the B0 or magnetic field. 

And all the protons in a particular volume, for example, the human brain, are aligned along the same direction, along that same static magnetic field.

So, again this is referred to as longitudinal or T1 relaxation. 

And when you plot this out in a graph overtime that basically displays the amount of magnetization overtime, you can see that this signal starts out small and becomes larger and larger. 
And at a certain point <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">asymptote (M0) up to the maximum possible value.</mark>

On the one hand we can measure the longitudinal or also refer to as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">T1 relaxation as indicated by the yellow arrow. 

So the yellow arrow essentially determines the distance that the precision is off the flat plain, off the xy plain, if you will. </mark>

So you can imagine that when the spin or when the proton is knocked over by a full 90 degrees that vector is 0, the precision happens fully within the xz plain.

## [[T2]] 
![[Pasted image 20230702152844.png]]<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The second aspect that we can measure in such a system is the transverse or T2 relaxation</mark>, indicated by the blue arrow up top.

This indicates the distance in the xy plane. And as you can imagine, as you can see, this factor starts out largest and  becomes smaller and smaller and smaller over time as the spin reaches its z axis, if you will, the B0 axis of the magnetic field. 

So this is a vector that starts out large and becomes smaller and smaller as the spin relaxes. If you plot this out over time you essentially get the inverse of a T1 signa;

Taking advantage ofthis we can start determining the mi d of image we have.

It is neccesary to do this at the right frequency:
[[Spatial Specificity]]:
• Precession or spins are in low
energy parallel or high energy
anti-parallel state.
• To change to a a spin from a low
energy state to a high energy state
electromagnetic energy is needed
• Frequency needed is known as
the Larmor Frequency:
