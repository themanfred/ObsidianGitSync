Neuroimaging techniques can be categorized by<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> purpose: assessing location and function</mark>. Methodically, a categorization can be made for nuclear imaging techniques & gamma techniques.

The neuroimaging methods divide into <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">two categories the structural imaging methods that have to do with the anatomy and injuries then there is the functional imaging that has to do with metabolic and pharmocologic studies</mark>

[[Electroencephalography]]

- measures electrical activity in the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp
- Measure activiy at rest or during prez. of a stimulus
- Assess localized brain response or brain networks through temporal ans spatial correlations

[[Computed Axial Tomography]]

• Series of x-rays
• Measures amount of x-ray
absorption
• Series of cross sections or
reconstructed to a 3D volume
• Fast, widely available but
involves moderate radiation

[[Single Photon Emission Tomography]]

Nuclear imaging technique
• Uses a gamma emitting tracer
injected intravenously
• Either as soluble ion or attached
to a ligand
• Measures gamma rays in a
series of 2D images from
multiple angles
- Brain [[SPECT image]]


A refinment of the SPECT techinque is the
[[Positron Emission Tomography]]

Positron Emission Tomography (PET scans)

Nuclear imaging technique
• Uses a positron emitting
radionuclide attached to a
biologically active molecule
• Scanner detects pairs of
gamma rays emitted to
construct 3D image
• Generates image of active
molecule binding

• Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)
is a marker for uptake of
glucose (tumors, Alzheimer’s
disease
• Florbetapir F18 (18F-AV-45 PET)
is a marker for beta amyloid
accumulation (Alzheimer’s
disease)
• [11c]PBB3 Tau is a marker for
Tau accumulat

[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]

- Nuclear imaging technique
• Uses static and variable
magnetic fields to perturb
hydrogen atoms
• Resulting magnetic resonance
is measured by radio frequency
receivers

• Different pulse sequences can
be used to generate different
contrasts between tissue types
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
• Magnetic field is very strong
• Dangerous to have any metallic
objects in the vicinity
• No radiation and no known side
effects
• High resolution possible. Good
[[Temporal resolution]]


[[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]
![[Pasted image 20230702115936.png]]
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
• Refined application of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging
• Magnetic resonance from
oxygenated versus non-
oxygenated blood is measured
• Used to asses

By measuring the amount of oxigenated vs. non oxigenated blood we can get an idea of areas of activation in the brain

[[Diffusion Tensor Imaging]]
Diffusion Tensor Imaging
• Refined application of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging
• Measures directionality of water
molecules to generate image
• Used to assess fiber
projections and
