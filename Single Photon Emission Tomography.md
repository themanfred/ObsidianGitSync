A single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan lets your doctor analyze your body's organs, tissue and bones. 

A SPECT scan is a type of nuclear imaging test, which means it uses a radioactive substance and a special camera to create 3D pictures.

## Why it's done

Some of the most common uses of SPECT are to help diagnose or monitor brain disorders, heart problems and bone disorders.

### Brain disorders

A SPECT test creates a detailed, 3D map of the blood flow activity in your brain, which can be helpful in determining which parts of the brain are being affected by:

- **Clogged blood vessels.** SPECT scanning can detect altered blood flow in the brain and help diagnose or evaluate certain vascular brain disorders, such as moyamoya disease, a condition in which the arteries in the brain become blocked or narrowed.
- **Seizure disorders.** A SPECT scan can help diagnose and treat seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, by pinpointing the area of seizure activity in the brain.
- **Parkinson's disease.** In rare cases, your doctor may suggest a specific SPECT scan called a dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan) to help confirm a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement.
