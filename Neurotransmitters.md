Having both <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">electrical and chemical methods of communication </mark>in the central nervous system offers the following advantages:

1.  **Speed and Precision:** Electrical signals allow for quick transmission of information and precise control over timing and coordination.
    
2.  **Long-Distance Communication:** Electrical signals enable communication between distant regions of the CNS, facilitating complex processes.
    
3.  **Chemical Signaling and Modulation:** Chemical messengers provide localized and specific signaling, modulating neuronal activity.
    
4.  **Neuronal Plasticity and Learning:** Chemical signaling allows for the modification of synaptic connections, supporting learning and memory formation.
    
5.  **Integration of Neural Networks:** The combination of electrical and chemical signaling integrates complex neural networks, facilitating sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive functions.
