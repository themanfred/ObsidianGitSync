Cortical expansion during early brain development occurs through the proliferation and expansion of neural stem cells and[[ neural progenitors]] in the [[ventricular]] and subventricular zones (Chenn and Walsh, 2002; Fernandez et al., 2016; Lui et al., 2011; Rakic, 2009; Sun and Hevner, 2014).

The resulting increased cortical growth and folding in the human brain are important factors that are associated with our capacity for high-order cognitive abilities

	Cortical growth is associated with intelligence andmental ability.

Main hypotheses are: external skull constraints (Le Gros Clark, 1945), mechanical folding by differential growth of superficial and deep layers of the brain (Richman et al., 1975;


These theories may not be competing alternatives but actually complementary, when considering the various phases of [[corticogenesis]] (Bayly et al., 2014; Hasnain et al., 2001, 2006; Striedter et al., 2015; Sun and Hevner, 2014).

. Although the precise mechanisms which cause stable patterns of primary sulci but high variations of minor sulci across individuals are not fully understood and demonstrated, it is widely accepted that normal cortical growth and the resulting folding patterns are crucial for normal brain function.

	Known sulci tend to be predictable but nobody know why minor sulci may vary.
	-Note: can we do a genetic test comparison to see if certain sulci patterns are more oriented or related to certain gene pools?
	
During normal brain development in infants and children, the cerebral cortex undergoes a process called cortical expansion. 

This expansion involves the growth and proliferation of [[neurons]], the formation of new connections, and the elaboration of neural networks. As a result, the [[cerebral cortex ]]increases in size, allowing for the acquiition of new skills and knowledge.
