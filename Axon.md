Growing out of the [[Cell body]] grows out axons.

It is a single process that might be short or incredibly long. Some can be mm or half a meter. It is really amazing since a [[Cell body]] tends to be 50 microns um.

They need a lot of energy to grow out and mantain the function of conductiong. 

They generate an electrical signal called an [[action potential]] propagates the electricity to the ouput zone and that is why it is considered a conduccting zone.

At the end of the axon [[Synapses ]] can be found
