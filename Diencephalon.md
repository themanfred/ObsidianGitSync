Found in the [[Forebrain]].

The diencephalon is **the central portion of the brain located around the third ventricle, superior to the brainstem (medulla, pons and midbrain), and inferior to the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex**. It is divided into four main parts including the [[epithalamus]], [[thalamus]], [[subthalamus]], and [[hypothalamus]].

It has the [[Thalamus]]

An just below we can find the [[Hypothalamus]] 


From this location to the back is what is known as [[hindbrain]]

Between the hindbrain and the forebrain is a small division of the developing neural tube that became a brain region called the 
middle brain, or the [[Mesencephalon]].

The [[thalamus]] is the largest subdivision of the diencephalon (see Figure 6). It is egg-shaped and is made up of many subdivisions, some of which we shall identify later. The [[hypothalamus]] lies ventral to the thalamus. Anterior to the hypothalamus is the [[optic chiasm]]. (Clinically, the close physical proximity of the chiasm to the pituitary gland is very important, since a combination of visual and endocrine problems is a strong indication of a pituitary tumor.) The mammillary bodies are a part of the hypothalamus lying in its caudal part just at its junction with the midbrain.
