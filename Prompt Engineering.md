Mastering the art of giving clear inpt text instructions to GPT-3 such that it generates desired output is called prompt engineering.

**Prompt engineering** is a concept in[[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] ([AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence")), particularly [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing") (NLP). In prompt engineering, the description of the task that the AI is supposed to accomplish is embedded in the input, e.g., as a question, instead of it being implicitly given. Prompt engineering typically works by converting one or more tasks to a prompt-based dataset and training a [language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model "Language model") with what has been called "prompt-based learning" or just "prompt learning".[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#cite_note-1)
