Within the classification of a “motor neuron,” there lies both upper and lower motor neurons, which are entirely different in terms of their origins, synapse points, pathways, neurotransmitters, and lesion characteristics.

The upper and lower motor neurons form a two-neuron circuit.

### Neurotransmitters

Upper motor neurons use [[Glutamate]], while lower motor neurons use [[acetylcholine]].
