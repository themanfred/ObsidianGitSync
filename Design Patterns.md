[[**Design patterns** ]]are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

A pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.


Apattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

-   **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
-   **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
-   **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
-   **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

The concept of patterns was first described by Christopher Alexander in [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://refactoring.guru/pattern-language-book). The book describes a “language” for designing the urban environment. The units of this language are patterns. They may describe how high windows should be, how many levels a building should have, how large green areas in a neighborhood are supposed to be, and so on.

The idea was picked up by four authors: Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. In 1994, they published [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://refactoring.guru/gof-book), in which they applied the concept of design patterns to programming.

-   Design patterns are a toolkit of **tried and tested solutions** to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
- Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently.
- 
The most basic and low-level patterns are often called _idioms_. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

-   [[Creational patterns]] provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    
-   [[**Structural patterns**]] explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    
-   [[**Behavioral patterns**]] take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
