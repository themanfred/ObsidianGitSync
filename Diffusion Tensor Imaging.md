Diffusion Tensor Imaging
• Refined application of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging
• Measures directionality of water
molecules to generate image
• Used to assess fiber
projections 


This is particularly used to assess fiber projections and the integrity of white matter. 



[[white matter ]]forms essentially the [[axon]] 

bundles that facilitates communication between neurons, 

and they're highly directional. 

By measuring the directionality of the water molecules within those fiber bundles, we can create an image, as you can see in the bottom right, giving a representation of the structural integrity of white matter, and the projections from one area to the next.

Studies in Diffusion Tensor Imaging
• Provides a measure of structural
connectivity
• Provides a measure of structural
organization
• Group comparisons
• Correlation with symptoms / events
• Correlation with cognitive
performance
