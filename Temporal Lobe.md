From the lateral surface of the hemisphere, we see three long, straight, parallel gyri, known as the superior, the middle, and the inferior temporal gyri.

So, between these three gyri are two sulci that are more or less straight and parallel. 
There's the superior temporal sulcus between the superior and 
the middle temple gyri, and then the inferior temporal sulcus between the middle and the inferior temporal gyri.
