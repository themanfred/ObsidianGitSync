Have a training set and learn and compute a mapping from A to B.


Test Set: Give the images with the correct labeling of what was trained in this case. The Training set is usually much bigger that the test set.

### Pitfall: Expecting 100% accuracy
- limitations of ML
- insufficient data
- mislabeled data
- ambigous data
