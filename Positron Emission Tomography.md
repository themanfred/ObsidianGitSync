Look at [[Approaches to Neuroimaging]]

Nuclear imaging technique
• Uses a positron emitting
radionuclide attached to a
biologically active molecule

• Scanner detects pairs of
gamma rays emitted to
construct 3D image

• Generates image of active
molecule binding

Positron Emission Tomography
• Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)
is a marker for uptake of
glucose (tumors, Alzheimer’s
disease
• Florbetapir F18 (18F-AV-45 PET)
is a marker for beta amyloid
accumulation (Alzheimer’s
disease)
• [11c]PBB3 Tau is a marker for
Tau accumulat
