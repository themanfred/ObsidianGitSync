Look at [[Brainstem]] and [[Internal Anatomy of the Brainstem]].

The order is from the different sections of the brain

In the brain stem we can find the [[Midbrain]] , [[pons]], [[Medulla oblongata]], [[spinal cord]].

We can find CN 1-3 (2 is not attached to the [[Brainstem1]]) in the midbrain.

1.  [[Olfactory nerve]] Sense of smell.
2.  [[Optic nerve]]:** Ability to see.
3.  [[Oculomotor nerve]]:Ability to move and blink your eyes.
4.  [[Trochlear nerve]]: *Ability to move your eyes up and down or back and forth.
5.  [[Trigeminal nerve]]:** Sensations in your face and cheeks, taste and jaw movements.
6.  [[Abducens nerve]]:** Ability to move your eyes.
7.  [[**Facial nerve]]:** Facial expressions and sense of taste.
8.  **Auditory/[[vestibular nerve]]:** Sense of hearing and balance.
9.  [[**Glossopharyngeal nerve]]:** Ability to taste and swallow.
10.  **[[Vagus nerve]]:** Digestion and heart rate.
11.  **[[Accessory nerve ]](or spinal accessory nerve):** Shoulder and neck muscle movement.
12.  [[**Hypoglossal nerve]]:** Ability to move your tongue.
We can see the [[Brainstem]]

### Cranial nerve 1  [[Olfactory bulb]]
is actually not present in the brain because it is a set 
of fine, fine axons that run from the nasal epithelium to this structure right 
here called the [[Olfactory bulb]]

![[Pasted image 20230509095115.png]]

### CN II [[Optic Nerve]]
![[Pasted image 20230509095311.png]]
Here we can find the  [[Optic Chiasm]] just behind the chaism we can find the [[Infundibulum]] . Here it is prone to grow tumors and because of the structure they tend to grow towards the [[Optic Chiasm]] .

So visual field deficits are the first and earliest  sign of a problem in the [[pituitary region]].
![[Pasted image 20230509095500.png]]

### CN III [[Oculomotor Nerve]] 

It supplies many of the axons that drive the movement of the eyes.
![[Pasted image 20230509095815.png]]

### CN IV [[Trochlear Nerve]]
One is that it's the only motor nerve that exits on the posterior or the dorsal side of the central nervous system. So, to see the trochlear nerve, we have to gently reflect away the [[cerebellum]] from the inferior surface of the temporal lobe.

This fine little thread structure right here at the tip of my pointer, this is the trochlear nerve. 

The trochlear nerve exits on the [[Dorsal]] aspect of the caudal midbrain, wraps its way around the brainstem and works its way towards the orbit, where this nerve is involved in controlling one particular muscle that moves the eye downward and inward.

This trochlear nerve was grown out by [[Motor neurons]] that sit on the left side of the brain stem in the [[trochlear motor nucleus]] of the[[ caudal midbrain]].

### CN V  [[Trigeminal Nerve]]
A large nerve that penetrates right through the lateral aspect of the [[pons]] and this nerve has been cut fairly close to the pons so we don't have a long length to show you.This tuft of [[nerve fibers]] that's right at the end of the pointer here that's penetrating down through the [[axons]] that connect the pons to the [[cerebellum]].
![[Pasted image 20230509101521.png]]


### CN VI [[Abducens Nerve]]
A nerve involved in moving the eyes. It's the most medial of three nerves that are present right along the junction of the [[pons]] and the [[Medulla oblongata]].
![[Pasted image 20230509101802.png]]

### CN VII [[Facial Nerve]]
It's one of our most complicated nerves and that it has both motor and sensory fibers associated with it that do a variety of functions 
![[Pasted image 20230509102000.png]]

### CN VIII [[Vestibulocochlear Nerve]]
And as its name implies, this nerve is involved in both vestibular funtion, related to our sense of balance, and auditory function, related to our sense of hearing. 

Nerve 8 sits in the lateral margin of this junction between the [[cerebellum]], the [[pons]], and the [[medulla]].
![[Pasted image 20230509103156.png]]

### CN IX [[ Glossopharyngeal nerve]]

![[Pasted image 20230509103118.png]]

### CN X [[Vagus Nerve]]

Just below the glossopharyngeal nerve are the nerve root  of the vagus nerve, which is cranial nerve 10. 

And we see a collection of these nerves that are emerging from the lateral margin of the upper medulla. Cranial nerve 10. 

Now, this particular specimen has been cut through the upper part in the medulla.
![[Pasted image 20230509103351.png]]


In the medulla is where we would find the nerve roots of our last two cranial nerves, nerve 11 and 12. 

So, to show you those nerves, I'm going to appeal to a model of the brainstem that I have, that will give you a sense of how those nerves relate to the medulla.




### CN XI  [[Spinal Accesory Nerve XI]]

Enters the cranium.
![[Pasted image 20230509105632.png]]
### CN XI  [[Hypoglossal Nerve]]
![[Pasted image 20230509140940.png]]The medullary pyramids contain axons of the corticospinal tract allowing the motor centers in the forebrain to communicate with the spinal cord. 

So, right next to it are the rootlets of the 12th cranial nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, which is the nerve that allows us to protrude our tongue.
