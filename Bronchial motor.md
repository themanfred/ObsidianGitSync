The Branchial motor component in nerves 9 [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] and [[Vagus Nerve]]10 comes from a nucleus appropriately  named called the nucleus ambigus. It's very difficult to see in our standard histological preparation of the brain stem which resembles a myelin stain. 

Of course if we stained for the presence of cell bodies, especially for motor 
neurons, we'd see the nucleus ambiguus quite clearly. 

But usually, histologists look at myelin stain sections of the brain stem, and it's  quite obscure. So that's the nucleus ambiguus supplying 

Branchial motor outflow through nerves 9 [[Glossopharyngeal nerve IX]] and 10 [[Vagus Nerve]]. 

The Branchial motor outflow through nerve 11 [[Spinal Accesory Nerve XI]] comes from the accessory nucleus in the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord.
