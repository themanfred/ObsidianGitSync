A great way to conceptualize the organization of the [[cerebral hemispheres ]]will be to actually allow you to see how I place my fingers on the gyri of the cerebral hemisphere.

The [[Central Sulcus]] is defined by to almost by two parrallel gyri [[Postcentral gyrus]] and [[Precentral gyrus]]

Orthaganal from the central sulcus we can place three fingers thar would represent the [[Superior Frontal Gyrus]], [[Middle Frontal Gyrus]] and [[Inferior Frontal Gyrus]]. Where the spaces are the [[superior Frontal Sulcus]] and the  [[Inferior Frontal Sulcus]]
