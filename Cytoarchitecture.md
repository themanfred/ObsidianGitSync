Cytoarchitectonics is one of the ways to parse the brain, by obtaining sections of the brain using a [microtome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome "Microtome") and staining them with chemical agents which reveal where different [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") are located.
