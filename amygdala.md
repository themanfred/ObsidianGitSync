The amygdala, which is a large mass of [[gray matter]] buried in the anterior-medial part of the [[temporal lobe]], anterior to the[[Lateral Ventricle]] and the [[hippocampus]] (see Figure 9). The amygdala is an important component of ventral-medial forebrain circuitry and it is involved in the experience and expression of emotion. It was once classified as part of the basal ganglia; however, it is structurally and functionally heterogeneous, with systems of neurons and intrinsic connections that are comparable to those in striatum and the cerebral cortex.
