There have been many approaches capturing various features of [[cortical folding]], such as the [[gyrification index ]](GI), [[fractal dimension]], [[curvature]], [[sulcal depth]], [[sulcal length]], [[sulcal area]], and[[ sulcal fundus curves]] (Fish et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2010; Im et al., 2008; Im et al., 2006; Kao et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Lyu et al., 2010; Mangin et al., 2004; Pienaar et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2008; Shimony et al., 2016; Zilles et al., 1988)

However, they do not investigate the spatial, geometric and topological patterns of sulcal folding.

[[Sulcal pattern variability]] was described in [[Onoâ€™s atlas]] by sulci categories based on the connection and interruption patterns to neighboring sulci (Ono et al., 1990).
