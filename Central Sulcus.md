roughly straight [[sulcus]], except for a distinctive S-shaped bend, that represents  the hand in the [[somatic motor]] and [[somatic sensory cortex]].

All of the cerebral hemisphere to the front of that central sulcus is the [[Lateral Surface of the Brain]], and the frontal lobe is comprised of a [[Precentral gyrus]], and then three [[gyral]] structures that run more or  less in the long access to the hemisphere.
 posterior boundary of the central sulcus is the long, mostly straight postcentral gyrus.


We can Find the [[Lateral fissure]]

The central sulcus is formed by the growth and [[morphogenesis]] of the [[Precentral gyrus ]]and the [[Postcentral gyrus]] of the cerebral cortex in the human brain.

At the end of the [[Cingulate Sulcus]] we can find the marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus. If we look for the very first sulcus from the line the marginal branch we will always find the central sulcus.

We can determine it is the central sulcus!![[Pasted image 20230508194507.png]]

We ascend that body map from the leg up towards the hip region, and then into the trunk. 

And then just where we see this distinctive s-shape bend in the central 
sulcus, that's where we know that our body map is progressing from the trunk to the forearm, and then eventually into the region that represents the hand.
The S shape is considered to be the area where the contralateral hand is found.

Just below the s-shape we have a representation of the face.

 So that the face now is represented for [[motor control]] in the [[precentral gyrus]] and [[somatic sensation]] in the [[postcentral gyrus ]]just below the tips of the fingers
