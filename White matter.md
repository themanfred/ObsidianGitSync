Also look at [[Gray matter]]
Would be the conducting zone. Find the insulation forming cells that surround the axons called [[Neuroglia]] glial cells

It has [[Vascular endothelium]] and [[Axon]]

These five terms are used to refer to bundles of axons: -  Column 
- Fasciculus (L., fascia, band or bundle) Funiculus (L., funis, cord)
- Lemniscus (L. from Gr., lemniskos, fillet) 
- Tract


Look at : the [[corpus callosum]], [[anterior commissure]] and [[fornix]]

Many of the axons entering or leaving the cortex do not assemble into compact bundles, except in the vicinity of the [[thalamus]] and the [[Basal Ganglia]], where they form a structure known as the [[internal capsule]]. The internal capsule lies just lateral to the [[diencephalon]], a portion of it separates the caudate from the [[putamen]]. Many of the axons in the internal capsule terminate or arise in the thalamus.

Between the cortex and the internal capsule, the axons of the white matter are not so tightly packed; they are sometimes called the ‘[[Corona radiata]]’, a reference to the way they appear to radiate out from the compact internal capsule to reach multiple areas of cortex.
