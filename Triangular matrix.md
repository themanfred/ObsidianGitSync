A triangular matrix is a special type of square matrix where all the elements either above or below the main diagonal are zero. The main diagonal is the line of elements that starts from the top left corner of the matrix and extends diagonally to the bottom right corner.

There are two types of triangular matrices:
1. [[Upper Triangular Matrix]]: In an upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the main diagonal are zero. The elements on or above the main diagonal can be any non-zero values.

Example of a 3x3 upper triangular matrix:
```
a  b  c
0  d  e
0  0  f
```

2. [[Lower Triangular Matrix]]: In a lower triangular matrix, all the elements above the main diagonal are zero. The elements on or below the main diagonal can have any non-zero values.

Example of a 3x3 lower triangular matrix:
```
a  0  0
b  c  0
d  e  f
```

The special property of triangular matrices is that performing certain mathematical operations, such as matrix multiplication or finding the determinant, can be simplified due to the presence of zero elements. Triangular matrices are commonly used in various areas of mathematics, such as linear algebra and numerical analysis, because of their simplified structure and computational advantages.

Look at [[Determinant]], when thre is a trianglular matrix the det. is the mult. of the diagonals.
