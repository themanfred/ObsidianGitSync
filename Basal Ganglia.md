 Regulates movement
.
 They can be divided into four main structures: 
 the [[caudate nucleus]], the [[putamen]], the [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[globus pallidus]].

Structurally and functionally, the caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens are similar, and they are often referred to collectively as the striatum, because of the stripes or “**striations**” of [[gray matter]] that run through a prominent bundle of [[white matter]] (the internal capsule) that otherwise separates the caudate from the putamen.

These three divisions of the **striatum** receive inputs from different portions of the [[telencephalon]] that define the functional roles of each striatal division. In general terms, the striatum (and the circuits through the basal ganglia that begin here) regulates **movement**, with the three divisions of the striatum governing different domains of movement. Thus, it should be instructive to remember that: 
- The putamen is concerned with the regulation of bodily movement; 
-  The [[caudate nucleus]] (especially its large anterior ‘head’) regulates movement of the mind and eyes (which often indicate what we are thinking about);  
-   The nucleus accumbens is concerned with movement of emotion or motivated behavior
