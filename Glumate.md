Glutamate is **the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in your brain and central nervous system**.

It's needed to keep your brain functioning properly. Glutamate plays a major role in shaping learning and memory. Glutamate needs to be present at the right concentrations in the right places at the right time.

Too much glutamate in your brain, in the wrong place, in too high of a concentration and for too long can cause brain cell damage or death. 

Some neurodegenerative diseases associated with having too much glutamate exciting nerve cells include Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease. Problems in making or using glutamate have been linked to mental health disorders including autism, depression and schizophrenia.
