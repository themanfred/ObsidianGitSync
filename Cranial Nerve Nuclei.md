This nerves are attached to the [[Brainstem]].

This relate to the [[Cerbral hemispheres]], [[diencephalon]], [[cerebellum]], [[Brainstem1]], and [[spinal cord]] 

Where the Sensory and motor components provide inputs and outputs.

Internal and external enviornment are relted to the Sensory receptors


Motor components are in the [[Visceral Motor]]

It includes the hindbrain.  The egg base structues is the forebrain and the [[Brainstem1]] 

We work with the 
[[Somatic motor]], [[Bronchial motor]], [[Visceral Motor]], [[General Sensory]], [[Special sensory]], [[Visceral Sensory]]

  It's a simplified way of explaining how one can relate the devleopment of the neural tube, to the more complicated mature forms that we see in the spinal cord and in the [[Brainstem1]].
