spins or  protons precess around their axis. 

As well as around the axis of the magnetic field, the static magnetic field. 

And they have a position either parallel, low energy, or anti-parallel, high energy along the axis of the static magnetic field.

We can measure the T1 or T2 and use that information create the image.


fMRI focuses on a different aspect:

![[Pasted image 20230702155142.png]]
- During rest blood contains a combination of oxygenated and
deoxygenated hemoglobin
- When neurons are active oxygen is consumed increasing the proportion
of deoxygenated hemoglobin
- Local blood flow increases to supply more oxygenated hemoglobin 

BOLD MRI - measure the difference between t2 and t2*

## T2 vs T2*

T2: Transverse magnetization decay of a spin after radio frequency pulse
T2*: Transverse magnetization decay from local magnetic field variations

The oxygenated blood is paramagnetic and it introduces inhomogeneity. 

It distorts the local magnetic field that is measured by the T2* measurement. 

Oxygenated hemoglobin is weakly diamagnetic and has very little effect on that situation. 
So essentially does not distort the signal there, if you will.


### So what is it measuing?
• Important to note that BOLD fMRI does not
measure neural activity directly. Rather is
measures metabolic demands (oxygen
consumption) of active neurons
• The Hemodynamic response function (HRF)
represents changes in the fMRI signal
triggered by neural activity

------------

fMRI signal, we have seen that at the onset of neural activation oxygen is removed from the blood to support the local cognitive processing that is happening in a particular area of a brain. 

Which changes the magnetic properties of the blood in that particular area. The activated state will cause an influx of oxygenated blood which again changes the local magnetic properties. 

By measuring that very carefully we can estimate or we can measure a hemodynamic response function for that area which certainly seems to be relatively well correlated with local field potentials, with local neuronal activity in that area.
