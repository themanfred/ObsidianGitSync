Look at [[Cranial Nerves]]

![[Pasted image 20230509153651.png]]


There are
- [[Somatic motor]] 
- [[Bronchial motor]]
- [[Visceral Motor]]
- [[General Sensory]]
- [[Special sensory]]
- [[Visceral Sensory]]

Nerve 7,9,10 are very complicated in very similar ways.

## Cranial nerves 4 x4 = 16
16 cranial nerve nuclei can be divided into 5 groups of 4
- 3 groups contain **motor** nuclei(12 nuclei)
	- 4 somatic motor nuclei
	- 4 branchial motor nuclei 
	- 4 parasympathetic motro nuclei
- 1 group of **sensory** nuclei (4 nuclei)

### somatic motor nuclei
Two somatic motor nuclei in the [[Midbrain]]
- Oculomotor superior and trochlear just inferior.

The next Somatic motor nucleus we have in the caudal pons and it's associated with the 6th nerve [[Abducens Nerve]]. It's the abducens nucleus.

And then, the final Somatic motor nucleus, the 4th of that first group is down in the [[Medulla oblongata]]. The upper part of the medulla associated with the roots of the 12th nerve and it is called the Hypoglossal nucleus [[Hypoglossal Nerve]] 

### branchial motor nuclei 
The Branchial motor component in nerves 9 [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] and [[Vagus Nerve]]10 comes from a nucleus appropriately  named called the nucleus ambiguus. It's very difficult to see in our standard histological preparation of the brain stem which resembles a myelin stain. 

Of course if we stained for the presence of cell bodies, especially for motor 
neurons, we'd see the nucleus ambiguus quite clearly. 

But usually, histologists look at myelin stain sections of the brain stem, and it's  quite obscure. So that's the nucleus ambiguus supplying 

Branchial motor outflow through nerves 9 [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]] and 10 [[Vagus Nerve]]. 

The Branchial motor outflow through nerve 11 [[Spinal Accesory Nerve XI]] comes from the accessory nucleus in the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord.

### Viceral motor

That comes from a nucleus called the Edinger Westphal [[Oculomotor Nerve]] which sits just superior and a little bit lateral to the ocular. 

The motor nuclei up in the mid-brain at the level of the 3rd cranial nerve. 
The next place where we have parasympathetic outflow is associated with nerves 7 [[Facial Nerve]] and 9 [[Glossopharyngeal nerve]]. And that outflow comes from a set of nuclei that we call the salivatory nuclei. Now we could subdivide them into a superior excuse me a superior and an inferior group. 

But to keep this 4x4 scheme going, we'll just collectively consider them the cell of a toy nuclei. Okay, well, the next major parasympathetic outflow to consider comes from 2 nuclei. A division of the nucleus ambiguous, which is separate from the one that provides Branchial motor outflow. 

This division is responsible for the cardio inhibitory output that goes to the heart from the vagus nerve. 

Well, the other major parasympathetic outflow to consider in the vagus nerve comes from a nucleus called the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Alright, well that accounts for our, three groups of motor nuclei.
