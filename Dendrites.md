They extend the surface area that allow [[Neurons]] to recieve input from other neurons. THey recieve synaptic contact.

Dendritic arborization facilitates communication with many neighboring [[neurons]].

They have a microstructural feature.
## Spines
Some mashroom shape pertursion or fillament or stacks

Wherever you can see a spike you can be sure that it has a synaptic connection.

Not all dendrites do not have spikes. Some of the are smooth. This cells tend to have an inhibatory effect (**an effect that suppresses or restrains an impulse, a desire or a behavioral process either consciously or unconsciously**.)

Morphology of Dendrites are a way to classify neurons.

**Dendrites are in the Input Zone**

There are particular morpholigies like the pyramidal neuron that has [[apical dendrite]] and [[basel dendrites]]. This dendrites and the distribution of eachorther are a good way to

We can se the morphology and the branches on the dendrites here
