Almost all the value in NN is through [[Supervised Learning]].

The basics of NN programming:
- M training set, want to process the entire data set without an explicit for loop to loop over your entire set.
- When you organizw the computation of a NN , we usually have a forward pass and backward pass and why they are organized in a forward a backward propagation.
